This is a simple set of helper functions for [ACF Fluent](https://github.com/samrap/acf-fluent) similar to the [`helpers.php`](https://github.com/samrap/acf-fluent/blob/master/src/helpers.php) shipped with ACF Fluent, but instead is auto-loaded by Composer instead of having to be manually included.

It also uses really generic function names because I'm naughty. :wink:

### Installation
